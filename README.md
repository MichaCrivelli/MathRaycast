# About the project
This project is one of my math exercises where I made 2D raycasts using linear functions in Unity.


# Try it yourself
You can try or download the project on itch.io : https://evercromby.itch.io/math-raycast  
It's available for as WebGl and .exe

# Learnings
This is not the recomended way of solving this Problem because its very performance heavy. Another drawback of using linear functions is that you can't really draw vertical lines because the incline of such a function would be infinite.

The better way of doing this would be to calculate the [line intersections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lineâ€“line_intersection) like [Daniel Shiffman](https://shiffman.net) has done in his [coding challenge #145](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/145-ray-casting-2d).
